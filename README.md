# Identus and DApp Integration Working Group

Welcome to the Identus and DApp Integration Working Group! This group is dedicated to exploring how Hyperledger Identus, can be integrated with decentralized applications on blockchain platforms such as Cardano. Our goal is to collaborate and share knowledge, focusing on practical implementations and technical challenges.

### Goals and Scope
The working group focuses on:

- Integrating decentralized identity with decentralized applications (DApps).
- Exploring smart contract interactions with decentralized identity.
- Developing design patterns for identity solutions in DApps.
- Building proof of concepts for decentralized identity in decentralized applications.
- The scope of our work is currently centered around [Hyperledger Identus ](https://github.com/hyperledger/identus) for decentralized identity and the Cardano blockchain for smart contracts.

### Participation
We welcome participants from all backgrounds! Whether you're a developer, architect, or someone interested in decentralized identity and applications, your contributions and insights are valuable. To join the discussions:

### Current Focus Areas
- SSI and DApps Integration: Exploring how decentralized identity can be integrated into DApps, focusing on Cardano.
- Proof of Concept: Building a POC where Cardano smart contracts interact with SSI using Hyperledger Identus.

### Future topics
- Smart Contract Delegation: Investigating the possibility of smart contracts verifying or issuing credentials.
- Anonymous Voting: Exploring anonymous voting mechanisms using decentralized identity, possibly leveraging Midnight for confidential compute.

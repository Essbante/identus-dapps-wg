## Discussion Summary:

### **Agenda Item 1: Introduction to Working Group Purpose**  
- introduced the purpose of the working group: to explore how decentralized identity can be integrated with decentralized applications (dApps) using technologies like Hyperledger Identus and Cardano blockchain.
- The primary focus is to develop methods of integration between decentralized identity and Dapps within the Cardano ecosystem, with some potential exploration of Midnight in the future.

### **Agenda Item 2: Exploring decentralized identity Integration with dApps**  
- **Key discussion points:**
  - How decentralized identity can be integrated into dApps, particularly focusing on Cardano ecosystem.
  - Initial focus on using Cardano for integration due to its established ecosystem and greater availability of developer resources.
  - Future exploration may include the Midnight blockchain for privacy-preserving use cases.

### **Agenda Item 3: Use Cases**  

#### **Use Case 1: Anonymous Voting**  
- **Discussion:**
  - Challenges in enabling anonymous voting using SSI due to the transparent nature of blockchain.
  - Suggested use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable anonymous validation of votes without revealing the voter's identity.
  - Further exploration of using Midnight's private compute features for anonymous voting and confidential transactions.
  
#### **Use Case 2: Credential Verification and Delegation to Smart Contracts**  
- **Discussion:**
  - Explore how a credential can be delegated to a smart contract, which can then verify the credential based on predefined conditions (e.g., payment, access control).
  - The idea is to allow smart contracts to handle interactions autonomously once the user provides consent.

#### **Use Case 3: Complex Credential Logic in Recruitment Platforms**  
- **Discussion:**
  - Handling recruitment where a candidate's credentials come from multiple trust registries.
  - The aim is to ensure decentralized credential verification without involving third-party platforms like LinkedIn.
  - Potential to use smart contracts to automate recruiter access to job seeker credentials.
  
#### **Use Case 4: Credential Issuance through Smart Contracts**  
- **Discussion:**
  - Whether a smart contract can issue credentials, for example, after signing a job contract. This process could automate credential issuance based on agreed conditions.
  
### **Agenda Item 4: Action Plan and Next Steps**  
- **Key decisions:**
  - Narrow the initial scope to focus on linking verifiable credentials with Cardano smart contracts.
  - Document the baseline use cases and challenges, particularly focusing on simple credential verification.
  - Establish a GitHub repository to collaborate on a proof of concept (PoC).
